# eTaSL in ROS2 

!!! abstract
    
    eTasl is a task specification language for reactive control of robot systems. It is a language that allows you to describe how your robotic system has to move and interact with sensors. This description is based on a constraint-based methodology. Everything is specified as an optimization problem subject to constraints.  This repository contains ROS2 integration to execute such task specifications and be able to interact through different types of interfaces with robots, sensors and other ROS2 nodes.

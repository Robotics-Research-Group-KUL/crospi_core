# Creating Libraries
TODO

- Mention to be sure to develop the libraries within an application template, since it contains the code to generate the json schemas automatically

- Mention conventions of folder to be the library name, but it is not necessary. For example when having multiple versions of the same library, one can change the name of the folders and be able to use both.

TODO: Check that the same library with the same version is not duplicated within the JSON Schema generation code
